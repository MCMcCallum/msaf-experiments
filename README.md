# MSAF Experiments

Experiments on Music Structure Analysis using MSAF published on ISMIR 2016

## Experiments

We explore different combinations for the following music segementation moving parts:

* Features
* Algorithms
* Evaluations
* Datasets
* Annotations

These experiments can be found in the [Experiments](https://github.com/urinieto/msaf-experiments/blob/master/notes/Experiments.ipynb) notebook.

## MSAF

The Music Structure Analysis Framework main repo can be found [here](https://github.com/urinieto/msaf).
